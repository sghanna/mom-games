# Hearts (Claude)

A complete Hearts game for Shawn's mom's iPhone, built from Claude's "Suit Rows" design in the Sept 22-23 design bake-off (~/hearts-bakeoff/claude). It is Claude's own project, separate from Codex's files.

**Live:** https://sghanna.github.io/mom-games/claude-hearts/ (published Sept 24, 2026). This folder is the working copy; the published copy is ~/mom-games/claude-hearts.

## Try it on this Mac

```sh
cd ~/claude-hearts
python3 -m http.server 8767 --bind 127.0.0.1
```

Then open http://127.0.0.1:8767/. For a phone-sized view in Chrome or Safari, use the browser's responsive or device mode at 390 x 844.

## What's in it

- **Full rules.** Pass 3 cards left, right, across, then a hand with no passing. The 2 of clubs leads. Follow suit. No hearts or queen of spades on the first trick unless there's no other choice. Hearts can't be led until one has been played (the queen of spades doesn't count), unless you hold only hearts. Hearts are 1 point each and the queen of spades is 13. Shooting the moon gives everyone else 26. The game ends when anyone reaches 100; low score wins, and a tie for low score is a shared win.
- **Three computer players** (Michael, Jerry, Barbara). They play only from their own hand and cards already played. They pass the queen of spades unless they have 5+ spades to protect it, dump it on a higher spade, play just under the winning card to avoid points, lead low spades to flush out the queen, and throw away hearts and high spades when they can't follow suit. They don't try to shoot the moon on purpose.
- **The screen from the design.** One row per suit (clubs, diamonds, spades, hearts). Each player's card appears under their name, labeled "Led", "Winning" and "Takes it". The player whose turn it is has a gold name box. The playable row gets a brass outline. A red "+3" badge shows points taken this hand. The big bottom button says what will happen ("Play the queen of clubs").
- **Tapping.** Tap a card to choose it and tap again to put it back. Nothing is passed or played until she presses the big button. Tapping a card she can't play shows the reason ("You must follow clubs.") instead of selecting it.
- **Pace.** No timers. Computer players move every 1.3 s on Slow (the default) or 0.8 s on Normal. A finished trick stays on the table for 3.8 s (or 2.4 s), and "Next trick" skips the wait.
- **End of each hand.** A results panel shows this hand's points and the totals, and names the next pass direction. After the last hand, a game-over panel shows the winner, with "Play again".
- **Menu.** Last trick, Scores, How to play, Settings (speed, sound, language), and Back to the game. "Start a new game" sits below a gap and asks first.
- **Saving.** Saves after every action. Closing the app or losing power mid-hand resumes exactly where she was. A damaged save is detected, explained, and replaced with a new game.
- **Works offline** after the first visit, and can be added to the Home Screen as an app (icon, name "Hearts", full screen).
- **English, Spanish, Vietnamese.** Chosen automatically from the phone's language, changeable in Settings, or via `?lang=es` / `?lang=vi`. **The Spanish and Vietnamese are Claude's own translations and need a native speaker to check them.**
- **Sound** is off by default: a soft tick per card and a short chime at the end of a hand.
- **Portrait only.** Turning the phone sideways shows "Please turn your phone upright to play."

## Tested (Sept 23, 2026)

- `node tests/rules.test.mjs 5000`: 30 rule checks plus 5,000 simulated games (54,865 hands, 713,245 tricks). Every play was legal, no card was ever lost or duplicated, every hand scored 26 (or 78 when someone shot the moon), and every game ended. All passed.
- `node tests/ui.test.mjs http://127.0.0.1:8767/ 3`: 67 checks, all passed, in WebKit (Safari's engine). They cover:
  - 3 complete games played through real taps, with no text overflow or scrolling at any step,
  - illegal taps explained,
  - save and restore mid-hand, and a damaged save,
  - the menus, the guarded new game, Last trick and Scores,
  - all 3 languages, including 2 full hands each in Spanish and Vietnamese at 375 x 667,
  - 13 cards on screen with 44 px or larger targets at 390 x 844, 390 x 763, 390 x 740 and 375 x 667.
- Offline play was checked in Chromium, because Playwright's WebKit can't reload any page while offline.
- Screenshots of every stage of a game were checked by eye in all three languages.

**Not tested:** a real iPhone, airplane mode on a real iPhone, VoiceOver, and Mom. On her phone, check: text size and contrast, whether Slow is slow enough, and whether she understands the gold outline and the "+3" badges.

## Not done

- **No undo.** The explicit Pass/Play button was designed to prevent mistakes instead.
- **Computer difficulty isn't adjustable.**

## Files

- `index.html`, `style.css`: the screen
- `app.js`: taps, drawing, pacing, saving
- `rules.js`: rules and computer players, no screen code, so Node can test it
- `i18n.js`: all words in three languages
- `glyphs.js`: the traced card lettering from ~/agy-solitaire
- `sw.js`: the offline copy
- `manifest.json`, `icon-*.png`, `icon.svg`: Home Screen app setup
- `tests/`: the two test suites; `tests/shots/` holds screenshots at each phone size

## Publishing a change

1. Edit and test here in ~/claude-hearts.
2. Bump `VERSION` in `sw.js` (for example `claude-hearts-v2`), or her phone keeps the old copy.
3. Copy the files to ~/mom-games/claude-hearts, then commit and push mom-games. GitHub Pages usually updates within a minute or two.

**Offline copy on a shared site.** Every game on sghanna.github.io shares one offline storage area. This game only deletes its own old copies. agy-solitaire's cleanup deletes every other game's copy whenever it updates. If that happens, Hearts refills its copy the next time it's opened with a connection (tested). The one gap: if agy-solitaire updates and she then opens Hearts for the first time in airplane mode, Hearts won't load until she's back online. Changing agy-solitaire's `sw.js` to delete only caches starting with `agy-solitaire-` would close that gap.

Test-only URL options: `?seed=N` deals the same cards every time and starts a new game, and `?fast=1` makes computer players instant.
